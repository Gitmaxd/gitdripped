# Metadata Header Template

## Field Descriptions

### title (required)
- Clear, descriptive title that explains the document's purpose
- Should be readable as a standalone description
- Use title case
- Keep under 60 characters

### category (required)
Choose one:
- `core`: Fundamental project information that rarely changes
- `active`: Current development work and state
- `pattern`: Reusable implementation patterns
- `feature`: Completed feature documentation
- `technical`: Technical learnings and solutions

### last_verified (required)
- Date the content was last verified as accurate
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Update whenever content is reviewed, even if no changes made

### version (required)
- Semantic versioning: X.Y
- X = major changes (breaking changes, complete rewrites)
- Y = minor changes (additions, clarifications)
- Start at 1.0

### dependencies (required)
- List of related files this document references or depends on
- Use relative paths from memory-bank root
- Include empty array [] if no dependencies
- Maintain bidirectional links when possible

## Best Practices

1. **Always include all fields** - Even if dependencies is empty
2. **Keep titles descriptive** - Someone should understand the content from title alone
3. **Update version thoughtfully** - Minor edits don't need version bumps
4. **Maintain dependencies** - Add bidirectional links where appropriate
5. **Regular verification** - Update last_verified during maintenance

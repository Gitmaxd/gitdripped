## Maintenance Patterns Observed

### Common Issues
1. **Outdated Dependencies**: Files often reference moved/deleted files
2. **Version Drift**: Metadata versions not updated with content
3. **Pattern Evolution**: Patterns change but documentation lags

### Successful Practices
1. **Regular Small Updates**: More effective than large overhauls
2. **Automated Checks**: Scripts to validate metadata save time
3. **Clear Archival**: Date-prefixed archives easy to reference

### Improvement Suggestions
1. Consider automated link checking
2. Create metadata validation script
3. Set up maintenance reminders

*This log is essential for tracking the health and evolution of the memory bank. Regular, documented maintenance ensures the system remains valuable rather than becoming technical debt.*
